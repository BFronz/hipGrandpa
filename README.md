# Hip Grandpa 


## Overview
This is Project 1 for our Rutgers Bootcamp class. Our team will apply newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. The design solves a real-world a problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. We will be working collaboratively; we will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.


## Project Details
HHip Grandpa will help users with the difficult task of keeping up with today's fast paced technological trends and innovations. Our team feels everyone should have knowledge and access to the latest trends. Our goal is to make everyone tech savvy with special emphasis on the older generations. One hope is the site will help Grandparents have real conversations with their grandkids about todays music, apps and lifestyle. Only then will we be happy.


But we still want a site that is still robust enough to attract other demographics.
